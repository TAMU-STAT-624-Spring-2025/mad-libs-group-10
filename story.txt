Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Michelle,

I am writing to you from a pretty spaceship in a cool galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a pink rocket in September. There are 18 cats and ears of dirt here! In the
mudroom there is a pool full of mercury. I fall asleep each night on a painstaking bed of
leather and dream of shooting hoops Quickly. It feels as though I have lived here for
seven hours. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
flying on a fast UFO!!

Best wishes,
Fatimah
